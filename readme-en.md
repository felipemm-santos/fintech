# 💰 Fintech – Personal Finance Organizer

This repository contains the **Fintech** project, developed as part of the **Analysis and Systems Development** course at **FIAP University**.  
The goal of the project is to build an application that helps people **organize and plan their personal finances**, while progressively applying concepts of **web development, object-oriented programming (OOP), and software engineering**.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal
The main objective is to create a financial planning application, evolving in **phases** that align with the course curriculum.

---

## 📂 Project Phases

### 🔹 Phase 1 – Basic Front-end Page
  - A simple webpage built using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.
  - 🎯 Objective: learn the basics of front-end development and understand how to use the **Bootstrap framework**.

### 🔹 Phase 2 – Core Classes in Java
  - Create the main classes required for the application.  
  - Methods not fully implemented yet – only `System.out.println()` statements explaining what they should do.  
  - **Objective:** apply fundamentals of **OOP** (classes, attributes, and methods). 

### 🔹 Phase 3 – Class Implementation
- Implement all classes needed in the project.  
- Add a `Test` class with a `main()` method to instantiate objects and test functionalities.  
- **Objective:** practice **encapsulation, constructors, polymorphism, and class relationships**.  

*(Future phases will be added as the course progresses.)*

## 🚀 How to Run

### Phase 1 – Simple Page
1. Open `index.html` inside the `fase1-simple-page/` folder in your browser.  
2. No additional dependencies are required.  

### Phase 2 – Java Classes
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA** (or another Java IDE).  
2. Make sure you have **JDK 17+** installed.  
3. Run the `Main.java` file located inside `fase2-java-classes/`.
